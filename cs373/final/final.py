# -------------------
# Background Information
#
# In this problem, you will build a planner that makes a robot
# car's lane decisions. On a highway, the left lane (in the US)
# generally has a higher traffic speed than the right line. 
#
# In this problem, a 2 lane highway of length 5 could be
# represented as:
#
# road = [[80, 80, 80, 80, 80],
#         [60, 60, 60, 60, 60]]
#
# In this case, the left lane has an average speed of 80 km/h and
# the right lane has a speed of 60 km/h. We can use a 0 to indicate
# an obstacle in the road.
#
# To get to a location as quickly as possible, we usually
# want to be in the left lane. But there is a cost associated
# with changing lanes. This means that for short trips, it is
# sometimes optimal to stay in the right lane.
#
# -------------------
# User Instructions
#
# Design a planner (any kind you like, so long as it works).
# This planner should be a function named plan() that takes
# as input four parameters: road, lane_change_cost, init, and
# goal. See parameter info below.
#
# Your function should RETURN the final cost to reach the
# goal from the start point (which should match with our answer).
# You may include print statements to show the optimum policy,
# though this is not necessary for grading.
#
# Your solution must work for a variety of roads and lane
# change costs.
#
# Add your code at line 92.
# 
# --------------------
# Parameter Info
#
# road - A grid of values. Each value represents the speed associated
#        with that cell. A value of 0 means the cell in non-navigable.
#        The cost for traveling in a cell must be (1.0 / speed).
#
# lane_change_cost - The cost associated with changing lanes.
#
# init - The starting point for your car. This will always be somewhere
#        in the right (bottom) lane to simulate a highway on-ramp.
#
# goal - The destination. This will always be in the right lane to
#        simulate a highway exit-ramp.
#
# --------------------
# Testing
#
# You may use our test function below, solution_check
# to test your code for a variety of input parameters. 
#
# You may also use the build_road function to build
# your own roads to test your function with.
