# ----------
# User Instructions:
# 
# Create a function compute_value() which returns
# a grid of values. Value is defined as the minimum
# number of moves required to get from a cell to the
# goal. 
#
# If it is impossible to reach the goal from a cell
# you should assign that cell a value of 99.

# ----------

grid = [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]]

init = [0, 0]
goal = [len(grid)-1, len(grid[0])-1]

delta = [[-1, 0 ], # go up
         [ 0, -1], # go left
         [ 1, 0 ], # go down
         [ 0, 1 ]] # go right

delta_name = ['^', '<', 'v', '>']

cost_step = 1 # the cost associated with moving from a cell to an adjacent one.

    return value #make sure your function returns a grid of values as demonstrated in the previous video.
