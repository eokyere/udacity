# ----------
# User Instructions:
# 
# Create a function optimum_policy() that returns
# a grid which shows the optimum policy for robot
# motion. This means there should be an optimum
# direction associated with each navigable cell.
# 
# un-navigable cells must contain an empty string
# WITH a space, as shown in the previous video.
# Don't forget to mark the goal with a '*'
